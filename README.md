# Deepfake Detection Project

## Overview
This project aims to compare the performance of different deep learning models in detecting deepfake images. The models evaluated are XceptionNet, EfficientNet, and Meso4.

## Folder Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `models/`: Contains model implementations, training, and evaluation scripts.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model training.
- `results/`: Stores evaluation metrics, plots, and logs.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `requirements.txt`: Python package dependencies.

## Setup
1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
